We are a safe, boring NFT vault. That is very $Dusty. You can pay us to store your NFT’s for the next year. We’re going to lock them in an old vault and keep a watchful eye on them. Like anything put in storage it will get $Dusty over time. In fact at the end of 12 months you can withdraw your NFT, plus your original funds, plus all your accumulated $Dusty tokens.

  - Connect your wallet
  - Ensure you’re on the right network
  - Make sure you have some $Dusty tokens in your wallet
  - Select the NFT’s in your wallet that you want to store
  - Select how much you want to pay / receive (the more you pay for storage, the more $Dusty you receive)
  - Set & forget. They’re in storage now, leave them alone and come back in a year.

We’ll also be hosting a charity auction with the winning artwork, allowing the FOX community to own a piece of history in the form of an NFT, with proceeds going to a wildlife-oriented charity we plan to reveal soon.

This is one of the big project, I have built NFT lending/borrowing system on Avalanche/Solana. You can lend and borrow NFT from this site and the price comes from the NFT oracle.
So you deposit this collateral, we see it belongs to collection X so the floor price is Y. We send 70% of Y (assuming the loan to value is 70%) and the loan begins. Now two things can happen (already coded in compound). Interest is accumulating, either you pay back the loan + interest and it sends your collateral back, or the loan + interest is too high and it sends it to a liquidation smart contract.

This is the easy NFT minting site which has one landig page.

In this project, I built the NFT minting contract by using Solidity. 
In this smart contract, I built WL Member Function, OG Member Function, and Reveal Time Function. Before reveal time ends, you can’t see your NFTs. It uses the different metadata URIs.
